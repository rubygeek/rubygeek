# Bible Memory

This is a simple project to practice common lisp. I will have a bible verse (or poem or what have you) in a text file and I want to memorize it. One aid would be to spit out the first letter of each word (leaving punctuation) and use that to study the passage.

Other ideas might be to blank out every other word with __.

Scramble the letters of each word, like a puzzle.

Maybe more ideas as I work on it more.
